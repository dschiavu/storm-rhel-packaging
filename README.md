Changes

* Fixed some minor bugs in the `init` scripts

* Added support for the Storm DRPC service (`init` scripts and Monit configuration)

* Added logback logger configuration, which has replaced the log4j
  logger in newer Storm builds (Storm >= 0.9.0-wip21)

storm-rhel-packaging
====================

Packaging for redhat and fedora style RPM installations, including init.d scripts, default configurations, and a .spec file for building an RPM. I have also included the built 0.7.4 RPM and associated dependencies (built and working in our environment). Also included are monit scripts that go in /etc/monit.d/ if you so choose. The source RPM contains the entire package I used for building. This gives storm a more cannonical fedora layout, with the storm working directories being in /var/opt/storm/(nimbus/supervisor/ui), logs going to /var/log/storm, and pid files being stored in /var/run/storm. Tweaks for config launches can be found in /etc/sysconfig/storm.

Install Instructions
=====================
[Download](https://github.com/rfliam/storm-rhel-packaging/downloads) the .rpms (the .src.rpm is not needed).
